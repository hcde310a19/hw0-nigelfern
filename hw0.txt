# Description of your program (part 7)
1. Read in the document file
2. Create a variable for storing the number of words in the document
3. Starting at the beginning of the document, scan through the document, incrementing the variable after each word
4. Distinguish words by detecting every occurrence of whitespace
5. At the end of the document, the variable will have the total number of words

# Reflection on writing your program (part 8)
# The previous exercise was a little challenging because it required me to think of the differences between how humans
# and computers think. It's tricky to describe the actions that a computer would take in English because you have to
# write out all of the intricate steps that a computer goes through when executing a task.
# Overall, I found this exercise interesting and helpful because it shows how while people can figure what you mean
# when reading instructions, computers need complete directions in the correct format to run a program correctly.

# From this course, I hope to develop strong Python skills that will help me in my future career.
# I also want to learn to apply this coding knowledge to design applications and interfaces that can solve human problems.
